## Installation and Running the Game

To run this game, you need to have Visual Studio installed on your system. Follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Run the exe file `GameUI.exe` within the root directory of the project to start the game.

## How to Play

1. **Starting**: The start screen shows when you run the code and the user(s) would need to click the `Add Player` button and add two players.
2. **Cards Selection**: Once the players have been added, you click the `Start Game` button to start the game. Each player will be given 5 cards from the deck.
3. **Battle**: Players take turns attacking each other. The attack power of the attacking player's character will be compared against the defense of the defending player's character. Damage will be calculated accordingly, and the defending player's HP will only be reduced if the attack power is greater than the defense.
4. **Win Condition**: The game continues until one player's HP drops to zero. The player whose HP isn't zero wins the game.
